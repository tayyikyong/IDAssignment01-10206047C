My website also includes my contact details and has a section to contact me. The purpose of this website is to present myself in the best light so that I would get hired. 
The intended audience are my future employers.

#Design process
I decided to create a personal portfolio website so that it would help me in the future when I am looking for jobs. I did my research by looking for other personal portfolio websites developed by other people to get inspiration from there. Eventually, I came up with the design for my website and created the wireframe for my website before using visual studio code and repl to code my website using HTML and CSS.

#Features of my website
The home page has a short greeting to introduce who I am and a button which will lead the user on to my portfolio. The button will light up upon hovering the cursor on it. The homepage also has the various social media icons like Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, etc. which will redirect the user to the various social media respectively to reach out to me. The social media icons will also light up upon hovering the cursor on it.

The website also has a navigation bar which follows the user when they navigate around the website. The navigation bar also minimizes when the screen becomes small like when on mobile devices. The various navigation buuttons also light up when the cursor is hovering on it.

The review boxes changes a different shade of color when the cursor hovers on each of it to make it more outstanding and to make its outline more distinctive.

The contact page has a bar which allows the user to input their emails if they wish to reach out to me and the continue button will redirect them to the sign-in page of their email.
